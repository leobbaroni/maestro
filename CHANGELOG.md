# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-19

- Single-repo marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) — install is now two commands.
- Dynamic upstream tracking: `upstreams.json` (pinned source commits + module map),
  `scripts/check-upstreams.mjs` (drift checker / re-pinner), and a weekly
  `upstream-watch` GitHub Action that opens an issue when sources change.
- `UPDATING.md`: full re-distillation playbook with a paste-ready AI prompt and the
  authoring spec.
- Recipient onboarding: README rewritten with requirements, three install paths, and an
  AI setup prompt; root `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` so any agent picks the skill up from a
  bare clone.
- `skills/maestro/templates/BRIEF.md`: the brief-lock template the Grill Gate freezes
  answers into.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-19

- Initial distillation: SKILL.md brain + 14 reference modules from impeccable, genjutsu,
  gsap-skills, threejs-skills, design-dna, motion-design-skill, remotion, hyperframes,
  plus the grilling/pilot/mockups process rituals and design-kit references.
